### Steps

1. **Create an HTML File**
   - Create a new HTML file and name it `HTML-2.html`.

2. **Set Up the Basic Structure**
   - Set up the basic HTML structure with the `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

3. **Add a Title**
   - Inside the `<head>` tag, add a `<title>` tag to define the title of your HTML document.

4. **Add Headings**
   - Inside the `<body>` tag, add headings to structure your content. Use `<h1>` for the main heading, and `<h2>` to `<h6>` for subheadings as needed.

5. **Add Paragraphs**
   - Below each heading, add paragraphs of text using the `<p>` tag to provide more information or content related to the heading.

6. **Organize Content**
   - Ensure that your headings and paragraphs are organized in a logical and hierarchical manner. The main heading should be followed by subheadings and corresponding paragraphs.


### Example Structure

1. **Main Heading**
   - Add a main heading using `<h1>`.

2. **Subheadings**
   - Add subheadings using `<h2>` to `<h6>` as needed to create sections within your content.

3. **Paragraphs**
   - Add paragraphs of text below each heading to provide detailed information.

### Additional Tips

- Use the `<br>` tag to insert line breaks within paragraphs if needed.
- Use non-breaking spaces (`&nbsp;`) to create indentation or tabbing effects.
- Ensure your HTML file is well-structured and easy to read.
