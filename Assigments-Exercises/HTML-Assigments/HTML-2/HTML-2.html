    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello I'm Ian, one of your project analysts for this year! I am 18 years old from Antipolo City and currently a freshman at PUP Main. <br>
       I don't have the best skills in terms of any programming language as I'm currently learning, so I hope to learn with all of you! <br>
       Let's all have fun and do our best this year! <br>
       BTW I'm an introvert so I find it hard talking to people in person, but I could probably talk in chat so don't hesitate to reach out! <br>
    </p>
    
    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
       For my hobbies naman I like playing games mainly valorant and osu! mainly, so if u want to play just hit me up. <br>
       I also like reading manhwa or mangas from time to time. I used to watch a lot of anime but currently, can't find the time to watch <br>
       Aside from that I don't have much else. I mean I stay at home most of the time so... I like football (soccer) tho :D
